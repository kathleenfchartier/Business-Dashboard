# Business-Dashboard
Granite State Distributers

I recently consulted with a small business to create dashboards for key metrics they track.  This project was created as a copy (with permission) of that endeavor.  All of the product names, company names and figures have been modified.

Technology
The dashboards were created using Windows Excel Version 2309, Build 16.  
It can be opened in the on-line version of Excel for viewing but not all the functionality is supported.  This is also true for the older Mac Excel version 16.16.27.
